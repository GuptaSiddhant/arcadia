# Arcadia: Online Game Store
TODO: Write a project description (What and Why)

## Team
Henri Ahti      
Siddhant Gupta  721936  
Santeri Volkov  528142 

## Features
TODO: What features we will be implementing  
Are there some extra features not listed in the project description?  
For each feature, how are we going to implement it?
## Models and Views
TODO: Initial ideas for what kind of Models and Views we will be needing, 
and how they relate to each other
(some schematics?)
## Collaboration (planned working practices)
TODO: How are we going to work? Will we meet face-to-face regularly, 
use some project management tools, etc.

(Proposal)Git

1. Clone it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D  

Or do we want to just push to master?

## Process and Time Schedule
TODO: Maybe rough estimates of time needed for each implementation
1. Feature#1
2. Feature#2
3. ...
