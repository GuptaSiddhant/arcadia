#######First draft
# Arcadia: Online Game Store
TODO: Write a project description (What and Why)
## Features
TODO: What features we will be implementing  
Are there some extra features not listed in the project description?  
For each feature, how are we going to implement it?
## Models and Views
TODO: Initial ideas for what kind of Models and Views we will be needing, 
and how they relate to each other
## Collaboration (planned working practices)
TODO: How are we going to work? Will we meet face-to-face regularly, 
use some project management tools, etc.

(Proposal)Git

1. Clone it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D  

Or do we want to just push to master?

## Implementation
##### Order
TODO:
1. Feature#1
2. Feature#2
3. ...
##### Timetable 
TODO: Maybe rough estimates of time needed for each implementation
